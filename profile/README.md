## 🧠 Why a Trainer Fits Avalon

Avalon’s design is deliberate, almost cruel in its patience. This trainer respects that tone:

* No intrusive overlays
* No visual clutter
* No scripted events broken by brute force

It’s especially valuable when:

* Repeating long corpse runs
* Learning enemy timing and stamina windows
* Testing magic-melee hybrids without respec pain

Think of it as lifting the fog, not burning the forest.
